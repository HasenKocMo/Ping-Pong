# Ping-Pong
Funny game for 2 players on 1 device
To play you need to start the game on 1 device where 1 player controls the left platform on the W, S and 2 player controls the right platform on the up and down arrows
As soon as the ball touches one of the platforms, it will bounce off it. If the ball touches the bottom or top walls, the game will not end, the ball will bounce off both the left and right platforms. As soon as the ball touches the left wall, the player who controlled the left platform loses, to the right - the player who controlled the right platform loses.
